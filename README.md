# 1 Overview

For this project, I have used various regression methods to predict the price of houses in the northwestern county,USA. The models start with a very basic simple linear regression advancing towards a complex polynomial regression. The main aim here is to attain a model that will best predict the price of a house with a metric error close to zero.

# 2.1 Understanding the Problem

Houses are slowly becoming the biggest investment one can make. The newest form of housing investment is the one where investors are now remodeling houses by improving particular features of the house with the goal of increasing its market value. To get a maximum return on investment, these investors ought to know which features of a house increase its value.

# Problem Statement

The main problem that investors willing to get into the housing market face is understanding the key factors that affect house prices. We will perform  regression analysis and find the relationship between the predictor variables and the target variable (price). The analysis will help determine which variables impact the price significantly and hence provide knowledge for investors on what features to invest on in the housing market.
